## Introduction
This is the PyTorch implementation of the paper DASFAA 2025: [Diffusion-based Hierarchical Negative Sampling for Multimodal Knowledge Graph Completion](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2501.15393). We propose a novel **D**iffusion-based **H**ierarchical **N**egative **S**ampling (**DHNS**) framework tailored for multimodal knowledge graph completion (MMKGC) tasks, which tackles the challenge of generating high-quality negative triples by leveraging a Diffusion-based Hierarchical Embedding Generation (DiffHEG) that progressively conditions on entities and relations as well as multimodal semantics. Furthermore, we develop a Negative Triple-Adaptive Training (NTAT) strategy that dynamically adjusts training margins associated with the hardness level of the synthesized negative triples, facilitating a more robust and effective learning procedure to distinguish between positive and negative triples.

## üåà An Overview of the DHNS Framework

## üíª Installation
Create a conda environment with pytorch:  
```
conda create --name dhns_env python=3.8
source activate dhns_env
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## üìÅ Datasets and Pretrained Embeddings
We reuse three multimodal knowledge graph datasets namely DB15K, MKG-W and MKG-Y in the folder ./benchmarks/ along with [MMRNS](https://github.com/quqxui/MMRNS).  
The visual and textual embeddings of the MMKGs could be downloaded from this [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UJSfnb8DEx2s-k8zaQx1fWUw5f45GBpI?usp=sharing). You can kindly put all the files of format .pth in the folder ./embeddings/.

## üöÄ Train and Test
In order to reproduce the results of DHNS model on the datasets, you can kindly run the following command with DistMult+DHNS on MKG-Y for an instance:  
```
python train_dhns.py
```
